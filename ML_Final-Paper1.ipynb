Furthermore, the number of records in the NSL-KDD train and test sets are reasonable. This advantage makes it affordable to run the experiments on the complete set without the need to randomly select a small portion.

    "\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "   - Logistic Regression is a linear model commonly used for binary classification. Despite its simplicity, it can be effective in capturing linear relationships and is well-suited for certain types of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**\n",
